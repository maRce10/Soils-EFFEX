## General info

General information about the project (study system, goals, etc)

## Main questions

1.  how does fertilization influence microbial CNP and enzyme activity?
    hyp 1 predictions:

-   +P addition will supress P enzymes (P enzymes \~ P treatment + site)

-   N addition will suppress N enzymes (N enzymes \~ N treatment + site)

-   both N and P addition stimulate C enzymes (C enzymes \~ N
    treatment + P treatment + site)

-   no a priori hyp for sulfatases (sulfatases \~ N treatment + P
    treatment + site)

hyp 2= +P addition will increase microbial P and microbial C to a larger
extent than N addition will increase microbial N and microbial C hyp 3=
+P will stimulate soil CO2 flux, but not +N addition

## Other questions that arose during analyses:

2.  Can site effects explain large intra-treatment variability in
    biological (microbial CNP, enzymes) response variables?
3.  Is natural variation in soil N and P concentration (e.g. due to
    distance to rio parismina) larger than increases in N and P induced
    by fertilization?
4.  Is there an interaction between treatment and site on biological
    response variables? e.g. N addition on a naturally high total N site
    boosts microbial N more than N addition on a lower N site?

## Fishing expedition

Multiple-regression type question: 5. Which variables predict Microbial
C? For example I get significant correlations between microbial C and:
total C, total N, Ca, Mg, Na, TEB, ECEC, BS; between microbial N and:
Total C, Total N, Na, TEB, ecec, bs; but microbial P is only correlated
with: Labile P, Ca, TEB, and ECEC (probably because labile P, TEB and
ECEC are all correlated with Ca, which is a contaminant of the P
fertilizer). 6. In terms of enzymes, soil pH is correlated with LAP
(N-degrading enzyme) and S (organic sulphur degrading enzyme); CEL
(C-degrading) is correlated with Al, Fe, and ECEC; AG (C-degrading) with
Nitrate, and XYL (C degrading, wood) with Total C and N. Pretty
surpising that P-degrading enzymes not inhibited by labile P, this goes
against theory. These correlations are significant but mostly weakish,
0.45-0.65. It looks like response variable is sometimes influenced by
site (from looking at boxplots of response variable by fertilization
treatment and site). how to incorporate site (categorical, 2 levels) in
a multiple regression?
